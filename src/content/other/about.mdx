I'm a JavaScript developer with over 8 years of experience, having worked across the full spectrum of development—from FrontEnd and BackEnd to Mobile app creation. My journey has been all about building impactful, user-focused products while tackling challenges from every angle. Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect UIs, optimizing server-side logic, or delivering seamless mobile experiences, I thrive on creating solutions that make a difference.

Curiosity is my fuel. I’m always diving into new tools, frameworks, or tech trends to stay ahead of the curve. Beyond coding, I enjoy collaborating with teams, sharing knowledge, and learning from others’ perspectives. One of my favorite mottos is: "When you hit a wall, just Read, Search, Ask. And when it’s time to recharge, make every moment of your time off count!"

Outside of tech, you’ll find me exploring side projects, tinkering with new ideas, or occasionally geeking out over a good sci-fi novel or open-world game. I believe in balancing hard work with creativity, and I’m always on the lookout for the next big challenge to conquer
